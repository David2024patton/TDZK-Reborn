  { term: "Accuracy", definition: "The more accurate you are with a weapon, the more likely you are to hit. Accuracy is calculated as a Percentage chance of hitting an opponent. Pilot Level increases your accuracy, as does a Targeting Computer Upgrade. Individual weapons also have varying accuracies. Your opponents Maneuverability will decrease your accuracy. See the Accuracy Equation." },
  { term: "Alignment", definition: "Alignment is a measure of how good or evil a player is. It affects what goods a player can see and buy, as well as what stations the player can dock at. Alignment is on a scale from -400 to +400. Alignment can be changed by buying goods, docking at non-neutral ports, and in combat. To determine whether or not you can dock at a given station, see the Station Docking Equation." },
  { term: "Armor", definition: "Armor, the defensive plating of ship's hulls, is the strongest of ship defenses. The Chassis value of a ship subtracts a flat amount of damage from all hits to a ship's armor. Then Armor Integrity reduces the damage dealt to armor by a Percentage. Armor is the last defense on a ship; when armor reaches 0, the ship is destroyed." },
  { term: "Armor Integrity", definition: "Armor Integrity (a.k.a AI) reduces the amount of damage dealt to Armor. Each time armor damage is dealt, armor integrity takes off a Percentage of the damage. This percentage is determined by the Armor Integrity Equation. Just before this percentage is taken off, the Chassis value of you ship class is subtracted from the damage. Armor Integrity can never take off more than 90% of the damage dealt, and even less if your opponent has any Damage Amplifiers. See the Armor Integrity Equation for more information." },
  { term: "Auras", definition: "Aura effects are generated by sectors or equipment on ships and effect all ships in a sector with certain effects. Some auras 'bleed' into the surrounding sectors. Aura effects that affect nearby sectors are considered Ranged aura effects, and are designated as such. There are both positive and negative aura effects of most types of auras. Most auras will stack with other auras of the same type." },
  { term: "Bank", definition: "Station banks allow you to store funds to keep your credits safe from pirates or hunters. You do not lose any funds in your bank account when you have been pirated or podded. You bank account can be accessed from any station." },
  { term: "Base Accuracy", definition: "Like Accuracy, base accuracy is a Percentage chance of hitting, but is applied differently. Base Accuracy is the chance of hitting even when you would otherwise have missed. See the Base Accuracy Equation." },
  { term: "Bounties", definition: "If a player wants a certain player killed, but is unable to do it of their own, they can place a bounty of credits on the player at a station. Thereafter, players can apply for the bounty job, and can be hired to destroy the player. Once they have destroyed the player, they can claim the credits at a station." },
  { term: "Chassis", definition: "The chassis value of a ship class is subtracted from total damage dealt to Armor, just before Armor Integrity is applied. The chassis value cannot be upgraded." },
  { term: "Critical Hit", definition: "Weapons have a small chance of dealing more damage when they hit. This is called a critical hit, and the damage dealt is anywhere from twice to four times more than normal, depending on the weapon." },
  { term: "Deployment", definition: "A little used feature of ships, you can \"deploy\" your ship for protection in space. When deployed, your ship is unable to move or initiate combat and is treated as having zero Maneuverability in the Accuracy Equation. When deployed, ships take 1/4th damage, just like a port or planet. Siege weapons can be fired at deployed ships." },
  { term: "Drones", definition: "Drones are the ultimate multi-tasking feature of ships. Drones can be used offensively, defensively, or for a variety of other purposes. There are six different types of drones that may be programmed: Scout Drones, Combat Drones, Repair Drones, Resource Drones, Mine Drones, and EMP Drones." },
  { term: "Effects of War", definition: "The effects of war add 25 to the Visibility Equation, making it easier to see opponents you are at war with." },
  { term: "EMP", definition: "EMP inhibits a ship's ability to function and fire weapons, thereby disabling a ship when it has received a certain amount of EMP damage. EMP damage can only be applied after the Shields are gone. One EMP damage means a .1% chance of misfiring a weapon, and a .05% chance of being unable to move or perform other ship functions (like cloaking)." },
  { term: "Equipment", definition: "Equipment add various abilities to ships. Only one piece of each equipment can be on one ship. Each ship has a limited number of equipment slots. Some pieces of equipment function automatically or provide a static bonus, while others must be manually activated." },
  { term: "Experience Points", definition: "Experience Points (a.k.a EXP) determine your level. Most actions that involve using turns give you experience points. Resourcing and trading gives you the most EXP, while moving and combat give you the least." },
  { term: "Exploratory Turns", definition: "Every player begins the game with exploratory turns, but can drop them if desired. While a player has exploratory turns, a player cannot transfer credits, but can easily 'start over' as a new race. Like Newbie Turns, Exploratory turns are used at the same rate as normal Turns." },
  { term: "Forces", definition: "Forces are Drones that have been dropped in a sector. These drones function independently of the ship, remaining in a sector for two days (unless refreshed) or until picked up again." },
  { term: "Goods", definition: "Goods are the basic Trading unit. There are many types of goods, each which are worth various amounts of credits and Experience Points. Some goods are also associated with a certain Alignment." },
  { term: "Hardpoints", definition: "Hardpoints are the available weapon slots on a ship. Hardpoints can be increased with Upgrades. There are a maximum of 20 primary hardpoints and 10 secondary hardpoints." },
  { term: "Initiative", definition: "Combat Initiative determines the firing order of ships in combat. The Initiative Equation is used to determine the initiative, and is based around ship Maneuverability, Pilot Level, and sometimes a Cloaking Device. Ships fire weapons in order, starting with the ship with the highest initiative result and ending with the lowest." },
  { term: "Maneuverability", definition: "Maneuverability affects how well a ship can evade incoming fire in combat. Maneuverability factors into the Accuracy Equation. It also increases Initiative. Ships can double or even triple their effective maneuverability by setting their Weapon Mode." },
  { term: "Newbie Turns", definition: "Newbie turns are given to players after registration and players that have been podded (killed). When a player has newbie turns, they cannot be killed, participate in combat, drop forces, and a few other minor things. They are a protection, of sorts, until they run out." },
  { term: "Percentage", definition: "Whenever something is referred to as a percentage chance, a Random Number [1-100] is generated. If the number is less than or equal to the percentage then this is a ‘success,’ otherwise it is a ‘failure.’" },
  { term: "Pilot Level", definition: "Your pilot level is determined by your Experience Points. Level determines how effectively your pilot can perform actions, including firing weapons, dodging incoming fire, and hiding. See the Level Equation." },
  { term: "Piracy", definition: "After a combat round, the attacker has the option to attempt to board (pirate) a defending vessel. The chance for the pilot to board is based on the EMP damage the target has taken: .1% for each EMP damage. Pirated ships lose 15% of their Experience and 90% of their credits on hand. The pirated ship also loses all equipment and weaponry, items, and cargo. Pirated ships lose six times their speed in turns." },
  { term: "Planets", definition: "Planets act as safe havens, ports, and bases of operation. A planet can provide several uses to its owners, including a base of operations or an additional money-making pursuit, but can also be useful to everyone as ports." },
  { term: "Ports", definition: "Ports buy and sell Goods. You can dock to a port for 2 Turns and undock for 1. No other services are provided at a port." },
  { term: "Power", definition: "Power is used by Primary Weapons when they are fired. Some equipment also uses power to activate. Like shields, power is easily recharged." },
  { term: "Primary Weapon", definition: "A primary weapon is a weapon that consumes Power when fired. It can be fired an unlimited number of times, limited only by the amount of power on the ship." },
  { term: "Random Number", definition: "Random numbers are generated in a range, usually indicated between braces([]), i.e. [1-100] for a Percentage." },
  { term: "Rating", definition: "A ship's rating tells how powerful, relatively, a ship is without seeing the ship's stats. A rating looks like: \"12/6\" The first number is the offensive or attack rating, and the second number is the defense rating. See the Ship Rating Equation." },
  { term: "Recall", definition: "When you are in an escape pod, you want to get into a new ship as quickly as possible. Clicking the recall link will use 100 turns and move your ship to a random sector in the Nexus system, where you can quickly buy a new ship." },
  { term: "Reputation", definition: "Positive reputation is gained when a Good Alliance destroys or pirates the ships of an Evil Alliance. Negative reputation is gained when an Evil Alliance destroys or pirates the ships of a Good Alliance." },
  { term: "Resourcing", definition: "There are vast amounts of resources floating in space. By resourcing them, you do not have to pay for buying the Goods from Ports. You only have to worry about selling them, making a much better profit (and more Experience Points) than Trading. Resourcing requires much equipment and Resource Drones to be effective." },
  { term: "Secondary Weapon", definition: "Secondary weapons do not consume power, but have limited ammunition. You buy ammunition and assign it to one of your secondary Hardpoints. Ammunition must be reloaded at Stations." },
  { term: "Shields", definition: "Shields are one of the weakest defenses on a ship, but have certain advantages that Armor and Drones do not. Shields can be recharged easily and prevent EMP damage from hitting the ship's hull. Shields must be destroyed before damage can begin hitting armor." },
  { term: "Ship Level", definition: "Your ship level is determined by what Upgrades you've placed on your ship. It determines the cost of future upgrades according to the Upgrade Cost Equation." },
  { term: "Speed", definition: "The speed of a ship determines how many Turns are received. A ship receives turns equal to its speed every hour. A ship can only store turns up to a maximum, equal to 200 times the ship speed." },
  { term: "Squadron", definition: "Your battle squadron determines how you get involved in group combat. This applies to ships in alliances only." },
  { term: "Stations", definition: "Stations provide many useful services to ship pilots. All stations have Ports. You can buy repairs, Drones, Upgrades, Equipment, weapons, or ships at stations. All stations have a Bank service to protect your money." },
  { term: "Trading", definition: "The basic action to get profit, trading Goods between two Ports gains both credits and Experience Points." },
  { term: "Turns", "definition": "Turns allow you to take actions. Different tasks use different amounts of turns. Each hour, on the hour, you receive turns equal to your ship's Speed. You can accumulate up to 200 times your ship's Speed." },
  { term: "Upgrades", "definition": "Upgrades are additions to a ship that modify a statistic of the ship in some way. Any number of upgrades can be bought for a ship, limited only by the how much you can pay. Upgrade prices are based on ship level." },
  { term: "Visibility", "definition": "Sector visibility determines how easy it is to see other ships in a sector. Visibility is determined by subtracting your opponent's \"Hide\" check by your \"Scan\" check. See the Visibility Equation for more details." },
  { term: "Weapon Mode", "definition": "By changing your weapon firing mode, you can make sure that your ship functions optimally in battle. You can choose to fire Primaries first, Secondaries first, only one type, or no weapons (for increased maneuverability)." }
