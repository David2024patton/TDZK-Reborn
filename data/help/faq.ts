  { q: "TDZK pages are all messed up. What is going on?", a: "The admins have made every effort to make TDZK compliant with as many browsers and platforms as possible, but there are still problems. For best results, use a browser such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer. Opera will also work, but isn't recommended. Plenty of other browsers may work, but have not been tested. If there are major problems on a browser or platform that make it difficult to play TDZK, please contact an admin and tell them 1) The nature of the problem, 2) Your operating system and OS version, and 3) Your browser and browser version." },
  { q: "I have questions not answered in the help files or this FAQ. What do I do?", a: "Visit the official TDZK web boards. There are hundreds of players, or even the admins, there just waiting to help you out. Most of them won't bite, honest! ;D" },
  { q: "What is the best way to get money or experience?", a: "The best way to earn money is to trade. There is no question about that. Gaining experience is a more contested issue, but trading and resourcing are the two contenders; it just depends on your style. The worst way to gain experience? Combat." },
  { q: "I keep getting killed all the time! What can I do?", a: "There is no sure way to avoid a ride in a pod (getting killed). The trick is to follow a few guidelines, to stay cautious and smart, and you'll take that ride a lot less often. Some hints: Move fast and don't hang around in a sector for too long. Follow the Notices and stay away from areas with recent kills. Stay away from scout drone forces of hunter that are online. Park in safe locations; while no port or planet is safe, avoid the low level/rating docks." },
  { q: "What is the best ship for...?", a: "The best ship for trading is a Freighter. The best ship for resourcing is a Resourcer. Other than that, there is no 'best' ship for any other purpose. It all depends on how you design them. Even the puny Frigate can be useful if you put your mind to it." },
  { q: "What level should I be to start hunting?", a: "There is no optimal level for a task. It's up to you to decide. Obviously, the higher the level, the better. A rule of thumb for determine what level you should be to go into full-combat is to look at the average level of players online at any one time, and pick a suitable level around there." },
  { q: "When and how do I get new turns?", a: "You get new turns every hour, on the hour. You receive 1 turn per hour per point of your ship's Speed. To increase the amount of turns you get per hour, simply buy a Main Engine Upgrade." },
  { q: "Where can I find...?", a: "For a complete station list, with what ships, upgrades, and equipment are sold where, you must go to external sites. Redial.net provides such a station list, as well as other useful features for TDZK players." },
  { q: "How do I get to these other systems I see on the galaxy map?", a: "You can travel between systems at jump nodes, shown on the system map. Jump nodes are listed under the system map with their destination system. To use a jump node, simply fly to that sector and click the jump node button in the bottom-right-hand corner of either navigation cross. This takes 10 turns, and moves you to the other end of the jump node in the other system." },
  { q: "Can I be attacked or pirated when offline?", a: "Yes. Logging out gives you no additional protection. Don't log out in deep space, or you'll regret it. There is no completely 'safe' place to be when logged out, though docking to a port, station, or planet is generally much safer than staying undocked. Which dock is safer, however, is up to you; consider port/planet level/rating, location, number of other players docked, etc." },
  { q: "I Logged in and found myself with 1 newbie turn. What is this?", a: "What has happened is, a server crash occurred in the past 24 hours. As an automatic safeguard to protect anyone who was adversely affected by this, all players are given a single newbie turn. This newbie turn acts exactly like any other, with one special exception. 24 hours after the server comes back online, this newbie turn expires, so don't expect to be invulnerable." },
  { q: "I just tried to login and it said my account is disabled! What happened?!", a: "If you have been disabled, its because you did something that was against the rules, whether intentionally or not. This includes, but is not limited to, accessing multiple accounts, exploiting loopholes in the game, and in general, breaking anything that is listed on the Terms of Service.\n\nYou believe you have done nothing wrong? Not to fear, there are methods through which you can resolve your situation. The first step is to head over to the TDZK Forums, located at forums.tdzk.net. Then scroll down, and find the 'Fraud Tracking' forum. Create a thread there and try to explain your situation. List everything you think might be relevant to your situation - and don't try to lie. The admins have tools to detect whether or not you are telling the truth in your claims, and lying will just land you in deeper trouble.\n\nShould you fail to receive any response through this method, your next try would be to email one of the admins. Their email addresses are listed in the contacts section of the helpfiles.\n\nIf even this fails, then head over to IRC and attempt to contact one of the admins directly." }
