  { name: "Weapons", desc: "When destroyed, ships have a small chance of dropping a primary weapon they had equipped into space as an item. You can pick these weapons up and put them into your cargo holds. They take up 5 times their weapon size in holds. You can bring these weapons to stations to either sell them, or to equip them onto your ship into empty Hardpoints. Some special weapons can also be created with the right equipment and items. No matter what else a weapon recipe might need, they all need a 'Derelict Turret' item to serve as the base." },
  { name: "Proteus Spores", desc: "This rare space-borne organism is known for its ability to survive in vacuum and harsh environments, and is prized for both its medicinal value and its uses in terraforming planets. Proteus Spores take up 20 holds each. Proteus Spores can be genetically modified using a Micro Factory Module and a Micro Refinery Module into a devastating anti-armor weapon." },
  { name: "Telurian Crystal, Pure", desc: "Telurian crystal is the most valuable mineral in the galaxy, as its semi-organic behavior and affinity for planar energy allows it to be used as the core for Subspace Jump Drives. Telurian Crystals take up 20 holds each. They can be used to create Crystal Jump Cores (allow one subspace jump) or Crystal Shield Capacitors (restore 100 shields when damaged) using a Micro Factory Module and a Micro Extractor Module." },
  { name: "Midas Cluster", desc: "Created by titanic forces during solar novas, or perhaps shaped by some other unknown spacial phenomenon, Midas Clusters are nonetheless extremely rare and valuable. These tightly compressed meteoroids are composed of gold, silver, quartz, platinum, and sometimes even thin veins of Telurian Crystal, and can fetch enormous amounts on the open market from both corporations and private collectors. Midas Clusters take up 100 holds each, and can be sold at any of the ingame stations." },
  { name: "Macrolyte Crystal", desc: "Macrolyte crystals are strange crystals that resonate in unusual patterns when near energy sources. They take up 10 holds each. Macrolyte Crystals can be used to create Crystal Power Capacitors (restore 100 power after combat) using a Micro Factory Module and Micro Extractor Module." }
