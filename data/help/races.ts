Although most Taenarians remain on their beautiful forested homeworld of Taenaria, they own most of the ports and stations. Their Wanderers, however, cruise the galaxy and are willing to help any pilots in need of assistance. Since all Taenarian ships are unarmed, attacking one is considered an act of villainy by all races and factions, even the pirates.\n\nTheir ship configurations are kept secret, but the equipment on board is undoubtedly far more advanced than anything the other races could produce.\n\nThe Taenarians are not a user-selectable race.",

It does give them, however, the ability to refit themselves for any task, giving them the most options.\n\nAll Derivian ships are equipped with built-in Scanners that get +5 more points to scan checks, (+30 total instead of +25 total), and also gain +2.5 scan with Scout Drones instead of +2.

    description: "The steadfast Zallun warriors have long been considered the most powerful race in combat. Each and every Zallun ship is a masterpiece of defensive technology, with additional layers of alloyed armor and boosted shield batteries galore. Their one weakness, however, is the reduction of maneuverability on ships necessary for their improved defenses. The slower Zallun warships can be brought down by repeated attacks from faster vessels.\n\nShips built by Zalluns gain +25% to Armor and +25% to Shields, but suffer a penalty of -3 to Maneuverability per Manueverability upgrade. They also receive a -30 Base Maneuverability penalty on their ship. This bonus to shields and armor also affects their Upgrades, meaning they receive +125 Armor/Shields per upgrade instead of the normal +100. Zalluns gain an extra Armor Integrity increase when buying an Armor Integrity Upgrade, gaining +10 instead of +8. Zalluns also have -15% cargo capacity, both on their base ships and on cargo hold upgrades. All Zallun ships receive an improved Structural Integrity Field Generator, granting them 75% Critical Hit negation.\n\nZalluns are very good in combat and highly defensive, but they develop slowly, and cannot build small, maneuverable ships.

Their ships are capable of outrunning any of their class and they are well-known throughout the galaxy for their swift hit and run tactics in combat. However, the modifications necessary for these unearthly speeds reduces the defensive strength of their ships, and therefore they cannot take as much damage.\n\nKitaran ships receive an additional +6 Maneuverability bonus from each maneuverability upgrade, but suffer -25% penalties to both Shields and Armor. This penalty to armor and shields also affects their Upgrades, meaning they receive +75 armor/shields per upgrade instead of the standard +100. All Kitaran ships come equipped with a special Spatial Rift Generator. Unlike the normal variant, this equipment allows Kitarans to use their Subspace Jump Drive even with hostile forces in a sector, improving the normal freedom of movement granted by this device. The Spatial Rift Generator also adds a +15 on Initiative checks as compared to normal SRG equipment. Kitarans also gain a +10 bonus on accuracy.\n\nKitarans are good at building small, maneuverable ships, but their larger ships are lacking.

Because of their work with EMP, Wraith ships have a 25% EMP resistance, reducing EMP damage they take by 25%. Wraith pilots are often loners and require stealth, and as such their drone technology has fallen behind. Their Combat Drones receive -2 points to armor and damage, their Shield Drones receive -2 points to armor, and their EMP Drones receive -1 points to armor and normal damage, with no change to EMP damage.\n\nWraith ships are very powerful in the hands of a skilled pilot but Wraith build patterns usually only include shields as a defense.
