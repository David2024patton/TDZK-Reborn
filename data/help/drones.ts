  { name: "Scout Drones", stats: { combat: 0, armor: 15, emp: 0 }, limit: 50, description: "Scout drones are programmed to spot other ships and hostile forces. Each scout drone increases your chances of seeing another ship in a sector by +2. (Derivian scout drones are more advanced, giving +2.5 instead.) Each scout drone also gives you an additional .5% chance of finding resources in a sector." },
  { name: "Combat Drones", stats: { combat: 10, armor: 10, emp: 0 }, limit: 50, description: "Combat drones are programmed specifically for combat. Combat drones are also useful for defense as they take all damage first before your ship. The accuracy of Combat Drones depends on the Drone Accuracy Equation." },
  { name: "Shield Drones", stats: { combat: 0, armor: 14, emp: 0 }, limit: 25, description: "Shield drones are programmed specifically for defense. Shield drones are very useful for protection as they take all damage first before your ship or other drones, and have more armor than Combat Drones." },
  { name: "Resource Drones", stats: { combat: 0, armor: 8, emp: 0 }, limit: 10, description: "Resource drones are programmed to collect resources in space. Each resource drone can pick up an additional 2 resource units a turn, in addition to your ship's gather rate." },
  { name: "Repair Drones", stats: { combat: 0, armor: 10, emp: 0 }, limit: 20, description: "Without repair drones, armor cannot be repaired (unless you have an Internal Repair Module or there are allied repair drones in the sector). Each repair drone repairs 4 Armor per turn. Repair drones will help in the repairs of all members of the owner's alliance, in sector." },
  { name: "Mine Drones", stats: { combat: 50, armor: 10, emp: 0 }, limit: 25, description: "Mine drones are programmed to explode upon contact, hence becoming mines. Mines are useless onboard a ship; mine drones are only useful when dropped. Mines use the normal Drone Accuracy Equation and have 10% Base Accuracy." },
  { name: "EMP Drones", stats: { combat: 5, armor: 5, emp: "1-3" }, limit: 50, description: "Like combat drones, EMP drones are designed for combat, but do less physical damage, instead dealing EMP damage. Like combat drones, they add to your ship's defense." }
