  Ports: [
    { title: "Introduction", content: "If trading is the lifeblood of TDZK, Ports are the vital organs. Ports are scattered throughout every system in the galaxy, and provide a place for players to buy and sell goods, as well as dock in relative safety. Each port shows up on the screen beneath the sector information. They are all named individually, most after the number of the sector they inhabit. Some bear specific names, like Concentric or Rim. These are usually stations.\n\n(Special thanks to Imperialist for writing this section, and to Javid for supplying examples.)" },
    { title: "Port Levels", content: "Ports range in level from 5 to 30. The higher the level, the stronger the port. Ports, although controlled by the computer and not by a player, level up just like players do: By gaining experience.\n\nIf the port is level N, then it needs (N^2)*275 experience before it becomes level N+1.\n\nA port gains a set amount of experience per level. Specifically, a port gains 1 experience per 100 goods it trades. Thus, if a freighter sells 1500 ore to a port, then buys 1500 crystal, the port gains 15+15=30 experience. The type of good does not matter.\n\nA port loses 10 experience every refresh. (refreshes are every 30 minutes.) Thus, if a port goes untraded with for a long, long time, it might lose a level.\n\nA port's level is calculated on refreshes. Even if it gains enough experience to gain a level, that level is not added until the next port refresh.\n\nA port loses 25% of its experience when it is raided. Any changes in level, however, do not go into effect until the next refresh.\n\nPorts, regardless of XP amount, will never go below level 5. A port will never be over level 30, but it's XP total may be so high that raiding it will not lower it's level.\n\nWhen ports gain levels, they receive certain benefits and bonuses.\n\n- For every 1 Port Level, Ports have 0.75 Damage Amplifiers. (Rounded Down) These upgrades only give a 1.33% damage increase each, unlike player versions that give 2.00% each. However, each Damage Amplifier still reduces a ship's damage negation or Armor Integrity by 8 points.\n\n- For every 1 Port Level, Ports have 1 Targeting Computer.\n\n- For every 1 Port Level, Ports have 12 more Combat Drones, and 12 more EMP Drones. All Ports also get 80 drones of each type free.\n\n- For every 1 Port Level, Ports gain 1.2 more turrets of each type of turret. (Rounded Down) All Ports also get 5 turrets of each type free. There are six different types of turrets, called \"Defender\" weapons. See the weapons page for information on their statistics.\n\n- For every 1 Port Level, Ports have 3000 shields, and 3000 armor." },
    { title: "Port Trading", content: "Ports trade with players when players click the Buy or Sell link inside the port. Each port has a certain stock of goods, ranging from 0 to 50,000.\n\nIf the stock of a certain good is at 26,000 or more, the Port will sell that good to the player. If the stock of a certain good is at 24,000 or less, the Port will buy that good from the player. The closer the stock is to 0, the more the Port will pay for the good. The closer the stock is to 50,000, the cheaper the Port will sell the good for. The experience the player gets from trading with the port changes as well. More profitable trades also net more experience points." },
    { title: "Port Refreshes", content: "Ports \"refresh\" every 30 minutes, on the XX:00 times and the XX:30 times. Two important things happen during this refresh.\n\nFirst, all the goods at the port are changed to new, random stock values. A port might have 2,500 Food and 46,000 Crystal at 11:59, and then have 26,000 Food and 0 Crystal at 12:00. This means that if players want to keep trading at that time, they will have to switch to different goods, or find another port with what they want.\n\nSecond, the defenses of the port refresh. If the port has been damaged at all, either by having lost drones or having its shields and/or armor damaged, it gains 20% of its total maximum drones, shields, and armor back, up to the maximum. This makes it more difficult to raid a port, if players take too long, and keeps the port at full strength throughout the day." },
    { title: "Port Raiding", content: "Raiding a port is one of the more dangerous activities a player can engage in. It is extremely important that players know what they are doing, and what a port will do when players try to raid it.\n\nWhen players raid a port, combat begins, similar to combat between two or more ships. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:\n\nPorts always win iniative. This means they shoot first, no matter what. Players won't even be able to damage the port unless they survive the port's attack first.\n\nPorts will never start combat on their own. After a player chooses to raid, the port will fire at the player's ship right before the player's ship fires at the port, but the port will never just decide to attack random ships nearby.\n\nEMP damage does nothing to a port, and they can't be pirated. The only way to defeat a port is to completely eradicate all of its drones, shields, and armor.\n\nWhen a port is defeated, it isn't destroyed like a player's ship. Instead, it is \"blown open\", and left defenseless. All of the ships inside the port are ejected into space, and can be easily destroyed by the raiding players, or their allies. The raiders automatically take half of the cash the port currently has, as well. (This amount is determined by the level of the port, how much trading has the port done recently, etc. See the Port Equations for more information.)\n\nThe port also loses levels and experience when raided, just like players do when they are defeated in combat. As soon as the next \"port refresh\" happens, the port will return to full strength, although at its new, lower level.\n\nPorts do a tremendous amount of damage when players try to raid them. If the players aren't in huge, well-defended ships they will certainly be destroyed. Examples of a Level 5 Port and a Level 30 Port are shown at the end of this page, to give players an idea of their strength." },
    { title: "Siege Weapons", content: "Ports are enormous bastions in space, and as such, they take reduced damage from normal weaponry. A laser burst that might cripple a small frigate would barely scratch a port.\n\nPorts take only one quarter (25%) damage from most weapons. A special kind of weapon can bypass this penalty. Siege weapons, like the PPW and Mortar weapons, do full damage to ports.\n\nThe downside to siege weaponry is that it can only be used on motionless targets like ports. (Planets and deployed ships can also be targeted by siege weaponry.)" },
    { title: "Port Examples", content: "Port Example: A level 5 Port\n\nA Level 5 port has:\n\n140 Combat Drones\n140 EMP Drones\n66 Turrets, 11 of each type.\n15,000 Shields\n15,000 Armor\n\nIf a port was a player, it would have a 1169/322 ship rating.\n\nIf five people attacked the port together in battleships with no upgrades, several of them would die.\n\nPort Example: A level 30 Port\n\nA Level 30 port has:\n\n440 Combat Drones\n440 EMP Drones\n246 Turrets, 41 of each type.\n90,000 Shields\n90,000 Armor\n\nIf a port was a player, it would have a 4273/1866 ship rating.\n\nIf five people attacked the port together in battleships, each having a few billion credits of upgrades, it is likely that several of them would die." }

  Planets: [
    { title: "Introduction", content: "In the TDZK universe, planets can greatly assist the long-term success of individual players and alliances alike. Planets can be everything from lifeless balls of gas floating in space, to sprawling, planet wide- metropolises, harbouring billions of citizens; and there is as much diversity among planets as among players.\n\nPlanets serve a great many purposes. They can be sources of income, safe havens for alliance members, and profitable trading stops for skilled merchants. Listed below is some information to help you get the most out of your planet." },
    { title: "Building On Planets", content: "Without buildings, a planet is little more than a small colony waiting to be conquered. Therefore, building your planet is essential to holding onto it and reaping the potential rewards. Since there is no such thing as a free lunch, this will cost you.\n\nEach building requires a number of turns equal to twice the speed of the builder's ship (regardless of speed), a flat rate of five-thousand (5000) manpower, and a sufficient sum of money. While the requirements for turns and manpower never increase, the cost of building additional buildings of any type increases with the number of that type of building you already have. For example:\n\nStormcrow, in his speed 16 ship, wants to build power plants on his new planet, Zarahemla. The first power plant will cost him 5000 manpower, 32 turns, and the amount of money shown on the screen. If he wants to build a second one, it will cost him another 5000 manpower and 32 turns, but the cost in credits will now be higher.\n\nFor the specific cost of a building, see the Planetary Building Cost Equation.\n\nBuildings can be broken into two main categories, each with its own subcategories. The two main categories are defensive and production/non defensive buildings." },
    { title: "Defensive Buildings", content: "Defense buildings can be classified as either active or passive. The following list will explain the differences.\n\nActive: Turreted weapons make up the active defenses of any planet. Each turret consumes 10 points of power per firing, regardless of turret type.\n\nIt is a good idea to keep a balance between accuracy and raw firepower. While a fusion turret will do more damage to a ship than a beam or missile turret, the beams and missiles are more likely to hit the target. EMP turrets do small damage, but can immobilize the attacking ships.\n\nPassive: Passive defenses include shields and drones. The only drones allowed on a planet are combat drones and EMP drones. While combat drones do more physical damage, it is a good idea to have at least a few emp drone, since EMP damage will slow down attackers by giving them cause to repair the EMP damage, thus eating up their turns.\n\nBe aware, however, that all of the planets drones attack only one target at a time, and that the damage does not spill over to another target." },
    { title: "Non-Defensive Buildings", content: "Non-defensive buildings represent the manufacturing capabilities of your world, as well as the more ordinary buildings in which people live, learn and work. Listed below are the basic Non-defensive buildings.\n\nColonies:\n\nThese are just basic residential and commercial structures. Each self-contained colony can comfortably support up to 100,000 residents. More may live there, but overcrowding will drive tenants away. Colonies can not be destroyed like other buildings.\n\nStandard Production Buildings:\n\nThese buildings are the ones that actually manufacture goods for the planet. All production buildings, except power plants, require 10 units of power/ hour, and some require additional resources in order to function. For example:\n\nAn ore mine can produce 25 units of ore each hour, and a chemical refinery can produce 25 units of fuel and 5 units of chemicals for every hour that passes. However, a crystal extractor consumes 10 units of ore and 5 unit of chemicals to produce 5 units of crystal per hour.\n\nSince so many buildings rely on one another, it's a good idea to have at least a few of each building, and the more production buildings you have, the more stable your planet's stores of goods will be. This can translate into increased revenue from exporting the excess.\n\nService Buildings\n\nThis category of buildings includes drone assemblers, armour repair shops, and goods exporting stations.\n\nEach drone assembler will produce 1 drone per hour, using a few units of electronics and machinery per drone.\n\nEach armour repair station allows you to repair 100 armour per hour at no cost.\n\nGoods exporters increase the rate at which your planet's goods are consumed in exchange for increased cash flow from exporting those goods. Beware not to have too many exporters, however, since having too many exporters may run your planets resource stores dry faster than the factories can produce them, leaving your population without the products they need to live. See the Planetary Goods Consumption Equation for more information." },
    { title: "Planet Defense", content: "Defending a planet should be one of the first priorities upon claiming one. Whether the planet has never been claimed before, or if you simply finished taking it from someone, the need for protection is always there.\n\nExperience has shown that large amounts of drones, shields and power tend to be the best way to defend a planet, simply because it takes time to shoot down all the drones and destroy the shielding, giving your planet time to recover, as well as giving defending ships a chance to reach the planet. However, it is unwise to be completely without turrets, since a ship that has been destroyed is no longer a threat to your planet.\n\nOnce again, balance is the key to maintaining a good defense- specialized defenses can be more easily defeated.\n\nRemember that your main goal should be to prolong the raid as LONG as possible. At the planet refresh, 5% of total shields, and all reserve power, will be restored. Planet refreshes occur at 45 minutes past every hour." },
    { title: "Planet Trading", content: "In additions to trading to ports, trading to and from planets can be an excellent source of cold, hard cash.\n\nA planet has three modes of trading: buying, selling, and not trading. When a planet's resource stores are low (red letters showing the amount of a particular commodity), the planet will buy that particular item, up to 50,000 units. At 50,000, the stores stabilize, and the planet goes into a no-trade mode, which means, as the name indicates, that the planet will neither buy nor sell that item.\n\nIf the planet is producing more goods than are being consumed, the no-trade mode will eventually switch to the sell mode. But the planet will only sell down to 51,000 units. Additionally, the planetary stores top off at 100,000 units of any given commodity.\n\nEach transaction made on a planet (buy or sell) will result in an increase of cash on the planet (sales tax), based on your current tax rate." },
    { title: "Planet Taxes", content: "You may tax your people up to 10%. Logically, a higher tax rate will bring you more money; however, the population will not be so happy, and some will leave. Each percentage of taxation above 5% results in a -1% population growth. Every percentage point below 5% will bring a +0.1% population growth.\n\nWhile maximum growth can be achieved by lowering the taxes to 0%, a 3% tax rate is probably a good bet for a young planet just getting started.\n\nRemember that your tax rate also affects how much money is made off of each buy/sell transaction made on your planet." },
    { title: "Planet Population", content: "A large population can be a mixed blessing, but as a rule the larger the population, the better. While a larger population consumes more of your planet's goods, it is also better able to defend itself, and it represents a greater income for the planet's owner. Beyond that, each person contributes 1 manpower toward your pool of manpower.\n\nFor every 150,000 people living on your planet, your planet gains a level, increasing its effectiveness in combat. See the Planet Level Effects for more information.\n\nA planet's population require several things in order to grow. A planet's owner must provide at least the basic necessities of life, including defense, in order to attract people to their planet. For each 20,000 people, at least one defensive building is necessary in order to make them feel safe.\n\nAt least one colony is required to comfortably house 100,000 residents. A lack of sufficient housing will result in a lowered population growth rate.\n\nThe amount of goods on your planet will also affect its growth. If your planet runs out of any one of its goods, the population growth will suffer. Also, if your planet is consuming more than it produces, one can expect that the population will slow in its growth.\n\nHigh tax rates (over 5%) will also drive residents away, since they are unwilling to pay such high taxes.\n\nOn the other hand, if your planet has plenty of colonies, a solid defense, and a high level of production (most of the planet's goods are in the green), the population will be more likely to grow.\n\nYour planet's population will also respond to the alignment of its owner. When the alignment of a planet's owner changes, the population will temporarily decrease, in response to their ruler's shifting policies. The old saying \"birds of a feather flock together,\" is the policy here. This also means that when a planet is taken, the captured residents may flee the world en masse, causing as much as a 30% drop in population after a world is taken.\n\nUnfortunately, there is only so much room on a planet, and there is a point where overcrowding becomes a problem regardless of number of colonies. For every 200,000 people above five-million, the planet receives a -1% population growth, effectively capping any planet's population at around six-million, give or take.\n\nBelow is a quicklist of bonuses/penalties for population growth.\n\nIncreased growth:\n\n· Low taxes (+0.1% for percentage below 5% taxes)\n· Planet has more goods than it consumes\n· 1 defensive building per 20,000 people\n· 1 colony per every 100,000 people\n· No change in owner's reputation\n\n\nDecreased growth:\n\n· High taxes (-1% for percentage above 5% taxes)\n· Planet doesn't have enough goods\n· Defenses are too low\n· Too few colonies\n· Change in owner's reputation\n· Planet is hit by weaponfire\n\nSee the Planetary Population Modifiers for more, specific, information." }

Players attack and defend each other in group combat, cannot attack each other, etc.\n\nMutual Offensive Pact\nMutual Defensive Pact\nThe two alliances are treatied as friendly towards one another (players of one alliance cannot fire on another alliance).

The Offensive Pact allows players to join forces in group combat while on the attack only, while the defensive pact allows players to join forces in group combat while on the defense only.\n\nNon-Aggression Pact\nThe two alliances are treatied as friendly towards one another; they cannot attack each other's ships, and their drone forces (even aggressive ones) do not attack each other. This treaty provides no additional benefits, however; players do not participate with each other in combat.\n\nCease-Fire Agreement\nContrary to its name, this treaty does not prevent alliances from attacking each other, and aggressive drone forces will still attack. It merely designates a \"Treaty\" status on relevant information, such as the ship examine page, to warn players about hostile actions versus the other alliance.

This treaty is mainly useful to keep cordial relations with other alliances without becoming too deeply attached.\n\nWar\nThis isn't a treaty. This is an all-out declaration of war!
