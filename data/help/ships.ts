  { class: "Escape Pod", size: 0, speed: 14, armor: 25, shields: 25, holds: 25, cost: "2,000,000", desc: "All modern space faring vessels are now equipped with these small unarmed pods. Even though pilots are often reluctant to abandon a vessel, many have had their lives spared by having these devices on board.\n\nThe pod is equipped with a micro-fusion drive and a low power subspace generator, allowing the occupant to get themselves to Nexus, the central star system of the galaxy. Its tiny power grid, however, is not capable of supporting even the smallest weapons or equipment, so it is a good idea to get a new ship as soon as possible.\n\nAn escape pod's recall ability uses 100 turns." },
  { class: "Frigate", size: 2, speed: 22, armor: 250, shields: 250, holds: 150, cost: "1,000,000", desc: "Frigates are the most common craft in use today. Untrue to their name, modern Frigates are small ships, built for speed and maneuverability. Cheap and easy to manufacture, they are used in large numbers by newer, inexperienced traders.\n\nWhile the Frigate's Armor and Shields values are low, it uses its Speed and Maneuverability to keep it in space. Frigates have little use in combat, though an occasional combat-ready Frigate can be found.\n\nFrigates can easily be taken down by anything except a Freighter or a Resourcer. Pilots are well-advised to find better modes of transportation than a Frigate." },
  { class: "Freighter", size: 2, speed: 20, armor: 350, shields: 350, holds: 300, cost: "15,000,000", desc: "With it's enormous cargo capacity, Freighters are the lifelines of economy. Since the advent of space travel, Freighters have been used to bring needed supplies to remote stations and traveling warfleets.\n\nWhile slightly slower than the Frigate, the Freighter makes up with its cargo capacity, making it the most profitable ship available. Its lower Maneuverability and fewer Hardpoints are countered by it's additional Armor and Shields, but this hardly makes it a match for decently equipped warships. Pilots of Freighters are advised to remain cautious in their travels, steering clear of unstable areas where pirating may abound." },
  { class: "Resourcer", size: 3, speed: 18, armor: 350, shields: 350, holds: 250, cost: "20,000,000", desc: "Very similar to a Freighter, Resourcers are used to gather resources from deep space. Resourcing, as it is called, is a fairly expensive endeavor to start, but gathering resources is free and gives much more Experience Points than Trading, but it is sometimes difficult to find resources to gather.\n\nThe Resourcer is slower than the Freighter and even worse armed, making it a ship you do not want to take into hostile territory with. It is less trade-efficient than the Freighter with only 250 holds, but with its Drone Hangars filled with Resource Drones it can fill its holds in only a few turns. Its drone bays are geared toward resourcing, with additional off-loading gear, and therefore its resource drones gain +1 gather rate. By sacrificing resourcing speed, the Drone Hangars can also be equipped with Combat Drones for added protection. As an additional benefit of the Resourcer, it comes with room for an extra piece of equipment, useful for the many pieces of resourcing equipment required for resourcing." },
  { class: "Corvette", size: 3, speed: 18, armor: 600, shields: 600, holds: 100, cost: "50,000,000", desc: "The Corvette, select ship of pirates and Border Patrol alike, is one of the fastest warships in general production, only the Interceptor outclassing it in speed. Utilizing advanced drive technology, the standard Cruiser hull has been rebuilt for maximum speed, creating a full-fledged warship capable of running down a Freighter, Frigate, or a Resourcer. The downside is that Corvettes have lower Armor and Shields strength, but increased Maneuverability.\n\nWith six Primary Hardpoints, two Secondary Hardpoints and four Targeting Computer Upgrades the Corvette can make short work of its prey, and has a decent chance against larger warships.\n\nHowever, 100 holds do not a trade ship make, and it's lack of Resourcing and Drone capabilities make this a combat-only ship. Its few holds can be used most effectively for pirating. Its lower defense ensures that you will have to retreat often from battle and then attack again later. The lower Power capacity also means that it cannot sustain combat for very long, although it can be a fierce attacker." },
  { class: "Cruiser", size: 5, speed: 16, armor: 800, shields: 800, holds: 100, cost: "75,000,000", desc: "The Cruiser is the best choice for a hybrid of drones and weapons, a difficult feat to accomplish. With decent speed and a few holds, it can be used for trading with poor efficiency. It also has enough weapons to hold off most attackers, and with 20 Drone Hangars, it is fully customizable for both combat and resourcing roles.\n\nCruisers are used by all factions, and can be modified to any use." },
  { class: "Destroyer", size: 6, speed: 14, armor: 1000, shields: 1000, holds: 0, cost: "100,000,000", desc: "With not a single hold or hangar to its name, this mammoth is designed for hard combat only. 1000 Armor and 1000 Shields keep this ship in the heat of the action longer than anything else, and a whopping 8 Primary Hardpoints and 4 Secondary Hardpoints ensures that this pitbull will bark far louder than a puppy.\n\nThe ultimate harbinger of destruction, the Destroyer is designed to take down other large ships such as another Destroyer or even a Carrier.\n\nThe slow speed and lack of hangars, however, means that this behemoth cannot repair itself in the field, and must return to a station for repairs. Even so, it can still take more punishment than other ships before it has to." },
  { class: "Carrier", size: 7, speed: 14, armor: 500, shields: 500, holds: 100, cost: "125,000,000", desc: "The largest ship available, the Carrier is the most important support craft in a fleet.\n\nEver since space combat began, massive Carriers have dominated over fleets as the brains of the operations. With it's huge drone capacity, it can be both a nightmare in combat and an efficient resource collector, although its bays are not designed for it. Resource Drones aboard a Carrier receive a -1 penalty to their gather rate. It can also repair other ships in the same sector, allowing extended military campaigns in deep space.\n\nThe Carrier's Combat Drones can easily overwhelm smaller ships, but larger warships with anti-drone weaponry can make short work of a Carrier. Once the Drones are destroyed, the Carrier is helpless, with its low Armor, Shields, and its low number of Hardpoints. The Carrier is best used in conjunction with other warships such as a Destroyer or Corvette." },
  { class: "Interceptor", size: 1, speed: 24, armor: 300, shields: 500, holds: 0, cost: "20,000,000", desc: "The Interceptor class warships are revolutionary in design. Combining the latest microfusion engines and multidirectional thruster pods, the latest addition to the ever-growing warship market is destined to rise quickly in popularity.\n\nBased upon the old Frigate class designs, the Interceptor replaces much of the Frigate's multi-purposeness to incorporate better defense systems and weapons while retaining blistering speed. The Interceptor is primarily used as a scout or in hit-and-run sorties. It's high maneuverability also makes it a prime selection for breaking past minefields and drawing fire away from larger, slower vessels like a Battleship or Carrier. Unlike the Frigate, it's upgraded Armor and Shields allow it to take more hits before retreating. The Interceptor also comes with 2 free Targeting Computer Upgrades.\n\nBecause of the design of the Interceptor, Armor is sacrificed for speed, and in it's absence are additional shield batteries. While Shields regenerate quickly and absorb EMP damage, they cannot take as much punishment as good old Armor." },
  { class: "Battleship", size: 7, speed: 14, armor: 1500, shields: 500, holds: 0, cost: "100,000,000", desc: "Recently, the Federation Security Council has released the designs of some of its larger warships to private contractors. The Battleship is a siege and blockade vessel, designed to pound the heaviest of defenses to pulp. Its upgraded secondary hardpoints allow it to carry 6 of the most destructive weapon available.\n\nIts Armor is composed of advanced null composites, allowing it to deflect more small weapons fire, such as the small pulse lasers of drones, which are hard pressed to penetrate its thick hide.\n\nHowever, the Battleship gains its power at the cost of independence. Other ships are required to service it, as it itself is not fast enough to do so. Its low Shields capacity means that most of the damage it takes will be directed to Armor, and it will need to be repaired by other ships." },
  { class: "Ranger", size: 4, speed: 18, armor: 400, shields: 400, holds: 50, cost: "60,000,000", desc: "The oddball on the private ship market, many can find no place for Rangers. A highly modified Corvette, these little buggers can't take the punishments of battle as well as their counterparts. What it lacks in Maneuverability, Shields, Armor, and Power on the outside, it makes up for on the inside.\n\nDesigned by Andromedan Science Institute engineers to be a science and electronic warfare platform, the Ranger's advanced internal power matrix allows it to carry more equipment than any other ship in service. The Resourcer is the only other one that comes close, but unlike the Resourcer, the Ranger is built for combat. As a support ship in a large battlegroup, the Ranger can be invaluable." }
