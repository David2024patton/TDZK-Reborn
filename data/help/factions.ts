  { name: "Federation of Races", description: "The Federation of Races is a conglomerate of all of the major races and worlds in the known galaxy. Headed by the Taenarians, the Federation has kept the peace for over three centuries. First created following the infamous Derivia-Zallus war, the Federation is a symbol of progress and peace.\n\nThe Federation of Races security council holds control over two major organizations: the Federal Navy, (Which includes the Marine Corps), and the Border Patrol.\n\nThe Border Patrol is akin to a police force, maintaining the peace in and around populated colonies, whereas the Navy is a military force whose purpose is to battle the organized pirate factions, take down terrorists, and counter alien threats to the Federation." },
  { name: "Border Patrol", description: "The Federation Border Patrol are the enforcers of the Outer Rim colonies. They are willing to help all ships of high repute, and defend colonies against minor pirate attacks and other hostilities. The Border Patrol is also entrusted with the maintenance of jump nodes, and to help control the amount of illegal goods smuggling.\n\nHowever, in recent times the budget of the Border Patrol has been stretched thin and many systems are not protected by them. Crime and piracy is rampant in these places, and merchants should be wary when the Patrol is not around." },
  { name: "Andromedan Science Institute", description: "The Andromedan Institute is a coalition of researchers funded by large corporations. Their ships are often found in deep space studying unusual or intriguing spatial phenomena, and their production facilities are famous for producing high quality hardware.\n\nWhile loyal to the Federation and a major supplier of ships and equipment to both Naval and Border Patrol forces, the Institute is nonetheless an independent contractor, and will usually sell goods to anyone... for the right price." },
  { name: "Rim Pirates", description: "The Rim Pirates are the largest organized pirate coalition in the Outer Rim. They are feared and respected for their savage and reckless attacks on Federation holdings. They have relatively weak ships, but are almost always found in large packs.\n\nMerchants are advised to stay clear of Rim Pirate ships at any time." },
  { name: "Crimson Fury Pirates", description: "The Crimson Fury is a mysterious and shadowy group. Though far smaller than the prolific Rim Pirates, they are composed of very skilled and extremely well equipped pilots.\n\nRumors place their funding in the form of bribes and protection payments from large corporations in the Outer Rim, and some believe that the Crimson Fury are also paid by some of these corporations to \"deal with\" their competition.\n\nWhile the Crimson Fury are not as bold as their Rim Pirate colleagues, they are still a force to be reckoned with, and as such all contact with them should be avoided." },
  { name: "Scarlet Avengers", description: "The Scarlet Avengers are a clandestine and very territorial lot. During the Scourge War their founder, Reynold Scarlet, struck a deal with the Federation of Races in which he was to be given the Cryptos system in return for using his core group of highly elite pilots to harry the Scourge rear areas, freeing the Navy to conduct larger scale actions at the front.\n\nHowever, Scarlet violated many parts of the agreement, and the Federation withdrew their offer to hand over Cryptos. Scarlet’s followers responded by seizing control of the system, and claiming it as their own. The war-weary Federation had neither the resources nor inclination to reclaim the system.\n\nWhile the Avengers are outlaws, they are not aggressive. Nonetheless, it is advised that caution be exercised when traveling through the Cryptos system, since it takes little to give the Avengers cause to believe “their” system is under attack." }
